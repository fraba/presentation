## **Digital Political Mobilisation**

- Case study: Italy's Five Star Movement Analysis 

- How internet technologies enabled grassroots political mobilisation

- And how Internet-enabled mobilisation is different from pre-digital times

- Mechanisms for political engagement beyond legacy network

- Concept of "**Internet capital**" vs traditional social capital

## Internet Capital: Key Points

- **Definition**: The stock of digital resources that enable collective action independently of existing social capital networks

- **Geographic Independence**: Unlike traditional *social capital*'s reliance on dense, high-quality interpersonal ties within communities, **internet capital** operates across spatial boundaries through digital affordances that lower participation barriers

- **Critical Limitation**: Lacks reciprocal commitment and social reinforcement of traditional networks, requiring external validation (such as legacy media attention) to achieve sufficient local density for sustained political mobilisation

##  Information Disorder Research

- **Creative Underspheres and AI Misuse (2025)**

  - Concept of the "**Undersphere**" - networked communities repurposing AI technologies
  - Risks to individual rights and democratic institutions from AI-generated content
  - Regulatory challenges in addressing emergent technologies

- **Far-right Information Strategies**

  - Analysis of extremist groups' exploitation of information crises
  - Performance-driven amplification during bushfires and COVID-19
  - Strategic use of information disorder

## **Current Research Projects**
- **Four Active Projects:**

1. **Vietnam Media Influence Measurement** (with University of Social Sciences and Humanities, Ho Chi Minh City)

  - Mapping political micro-influencer operations across Vietnamese social media
  - AI-powered analysis of influence campaigns and information manipulation
  - Computational dashboard for measuring digital influence effectiveness
  - (AU$45,000 SSEAC Ignition Grant, 2025)

2. **YouTube Violence Perception Mapping** (with Institute for Economics and Peace)
   - Using AI to detect perceptions of violence in YouTube comments
   - Early warning systems for political instability
   - Real-time violence perception indices
   - (Currently under review, Linkage Program)

---
  
3\. **Information Disorder and Democratic Trust** (Social Media Experiment)
   - Controlled experiments on conflicting information exposure
   - Impact on trust in institutions and voting behaviour
   - Testing interventions to mitigate information disorder
   - (Currently under review, Discovery Projects Program)
  
4\. **Agent-Based Modelling of Information Disorder** (with University of Toronto)
   - Measuring information disorder as a systemic phenomenon

### 4. Pain Points & Solutions

- **Challenge:** Interdisciplinary barriers between technical and social science domains
- **Solution:** Building bridges through collaborative research centres and mixed-method approaches (but it takes time!)

--
----
- **Challenge:** Translating academic research into policy impact
- **Solution:** Embedded partnerships with organisations like Institute for Economics and Peace and direct government engagement

--
----
- **Challenge:** Keeping pace with rapidly evolving digital technologies
- **Solution:** Agile research methods, maintain library of half-baked research ideas to quickly tap into and continuous collaboration with industry partners.

---

### 5. Career Highlight

**Most Significant Achievement:** Establishing interdisciplinary and computational approaches to understanding digital technology (social media and now AI) impact on democratic institutions.

- Framing traditional political science issues into new contexts shaped by emerging technologies. 

- Bringing non-traditional data and computational methods to the analysis of these issues

- Creating mixed-methods collaborations within and outside of academia.

## Key Themes guiding my research

1. **Democratic Resilience:** How digital technologies can both strengthen and threaten democratic institutions
2. **Interdisciplinary, Mixed-methods Innovation:** The necessity of combining technical expertise with social science understanding
3. **Policy Translation:** Moving from academic research to actionable governance solutions
4. **Future Challenges:** Preparing for the next wave of AI-driven political and social transformation

---

## Takeaway Message

As AI technologies rapidly reshape information environments already transformed by two decades of digital innovation, research must move beyond observation to actively inform governance frameworks. 

The Centre for AI, Trust and Governance embodies this imperative, combining rigorous interdisciplinary scholarship with direct policy engagement to ensure technological development strengthens rather than undermines democratic institutions.
