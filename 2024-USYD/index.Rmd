### How and Why to use Wikibase for research?

---

### Introduction

Wikibase is an open-source extension of MediaWiki, allowing for the creation of semi-structured data items and complex semantic queries.

I'll provide an quick overview of Wikibase as a collaborative research tool, showcasing its application for mapping online conversations.

- Customizable knowledge base
- Project ontology creation and maintenance
- SPARQL query service and interactive graph visualization
- Programmatic access to the knowledge base

---

### What is Wikibase

Wikibase is the software behind Wikidata, enabling the creation of complex, domain-specific knowledge graphs. It extends MediaWiki with a web interface, query services, and tools for data import/export.

- Used for diverse projects (e.g., biomedical data, library resources)
- Inherits all MediaWiki functionalities

---

### Who Needs Wikibase

Wikibase is ideal for collaborative research projects requiring complex knowledge bases. Its flexible structure accommodates various data types and evolves with project data.

- Supports text, images, audio, and videos
- Semi-structured data adapts over time

---

### What are Linked Data

Linked data enriches data entities with relationships, forming directed graphs for complex queries. It uses triples (subject, predicate, object) to create statements.

- Enables sophisticated data navigation
- Forms the basis of Linked Open Data (LOD)

---

### How and Where to Install Wikibase

Wikibase can be installed locally or via cloud solutions, with Docker recommended for local installations. The process involves cloning the release pipeline, setting up the directory, editing environment files, and starting the application with Docker commands.

- Two installation options: local or cloud
- Docker simplifies deployment and sandboxing

The installation will them be accessible via the web authenticating with username/password.

---

### Designing and Maintaining Your Project Ontology

A project ontology  (a.k.a., the codebook) defines the scope, domain, and vocabulary for data, balancing between existing standards and new creations. Wikibase's version control supports the adaptation and maintenance of ontologies.

- Defines objects, characteristics, and relationships
- Facilitates integration and coherence in knowledge bases

---

### Designing Collaborative Research Projects with Wikibase

Wikibase supports the entire lifecycle of collaborative research projects, from ontology creation to data entry and querying. 

Critical steps include 

1. ontology creation, 
2. data entry, 
3. data query, and 
4. computational access to data.

- Items and properties define ontology and project data
- Example: mapping social media interactions

---

### Ontology Creation

Items represent objects, while properties link items or values. 

Statements like 

- (user) – (instance of) → (class) and 

- (user) – (subclass of) → (actor) 

- (@realDonaldTrump) – (instance of) → (user)  

ensure bi-directional relationship coding.

- Metadata recorded under various properties
- Enables detailed exploration and analysis

---

### Data Entry

Data entry is intuitive, requiring minimal technical knowledge and facilitating multidisciplinary collaboration. 

Items and properties are created through a simple interface.

- Accessible to researchers of any discipline
- Prioritizes subject matter expertise over technical skills

---

### Data Query

Basic exploration is done through property labels or keyword searches, while complex queries use SPARQL. 

For example, with the following SPARQL query, we request 

1. all social media posts (defined by the property instance of (`P4`) social media post (`Q18`)) in the knowledge base, 
2. along with the themes they have been labelled with (has theme (`P31`)):

```
SELECT ?post ?theme
  WHERE {
   ?post wdt:P4 wd:Q18.
   ?post wdt:P31 ?theme.
   }
```

---

### Computational Access to Data

Wikibase allows programmatic data access, integrating qualitative and quantitative approaches. 

An example pipeline involves manual entry of social media posts, classifier training, and automatic classification with optional qualitative review.

- Enhances mixed-methods research
- Improves classifier accuracy through human feedback
