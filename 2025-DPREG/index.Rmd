## Why This Matters

AI, especially Generative AI technologies and tools, will be ubiquitous and strongly integrated with the existing infrastructure of digital and social platforms

In **2024**,

- **Over half of Australians** (51%) accessed **news more than once a day**, a 3 percentage point increase from the prior year.
- **Almost half of Australians** (49%) **used social media to access news**, marking a 4 percentage point increase since the prior year.
- **Nearly two-thirds of Gen Z** (60%) **relied on social media as their main news source**, a significant increase of 17 percentage points over the past year.
- Trust in news generally fell slightly (-3pp) to 40%, but **distrust rose consistently and reached its highest point since 2016** (33%, +8pp).

### These systems increasingly mediate: 

- Access to political information
- Political engagement and participation
- Electoral and civic processes

### Our recent research shows these systems:

1. Reshape *who* is reached and *how* people are activated politically; 
2. Create new risks of information disorders;
3. Challenge regulatory and governance models.

## Trend 1  
### Information Disorder and Political Performance


Key insights:
- Far-right actors in Australia amplified their performance online during crises (bushfires, COVID-19)
- They moved from peripheral actors to central positions in the public Twitter conversation
- **AI + platforms amplify epistemic gaps** — people seek meaning where the official system lags

Rizoiu, ‘Riding information crises: The performance of far-right Twitter users in Australia during the 2019–2020 bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic’, *Information, Communication & Society*, vol. 27, no. 2, pp. 278–296, 2024, doi: 10.1080/1369118X.2023.2205479.]

## Challenge 1  
### Coordinated Manipulation

- Coordinated, either authentic or inauthentic behavior (bots, cyborg accounts, social manipulation)
- Far-right networks linked to QAnon overperformed in spreading COVID-19 misinformation
- Platforms struggle to detect sophisticated, semi-automated influence campaigns
- → Regulatory challenge: How do we govern digital ecosystems that can be hijacked at scale?

---

## Trend 2  
### Platform Governance and Resistance

From:  
Johns, Bailo & Rizoiu (2024)  
“Labelling, Shadow Bans and Community Resistance”

Key insights:
- Meta’s strategies (labels, shadow bans) reduced some COVID-19 misinformation but:
  - In the US, platforms such as Meta stopped many content moderation activities after the 2024 election, raising concerns about the future handling of misinformation
  - Meta and X (formerly Twitter) have made it increasingly difficult for academics and journalists to access social media data, limiting independent oversight (referencing our Conversation article on coordinated, inauthentic behavior)
  - Communities developed **resistance tactics** (social steganography, migration to less-moderated spaces)
  - Moderation transparency gaps fueled conspiratorial thinking

---

## Challenge 2  
### Moderation Backfires and Trust Erosion

- Content moderation can amplify perceptions of political bias or censorship
- Platform opacity invites backlash from fringe and mainstream actors alike
- → Governance question: How can statutory authorities ensure fair, transparent platform governance without escalating distrust?

---

## Trend 3  
### AI Misuse and Creative Underspheres

From:  
Stilinovic, Bailo & Hutchinson (2025)  
“Creative Underspheres and Democratic Challenges”

Key insights:
- Generative AI fosters emergent, informal creative communities (Underspheres)
- These communities often innovate **outside** normative frameworks — but can also:
  - Create and distribute deepfakes, disinformation, non-consensual media
  - Bypass existing legal and regulatory boundaries

---

## Challenge 3  
### Complex Risk, Not Just High/Low Risk

- GenAI systems introduce complex, emergent risks
- Current regulatory frameworks (like EU AI Act) are rigid, focused on **market actors**
- But most severe risks (e.g., AI-driven disinformation) emerge from decentralized, non-market misuse
- → Policy challenge: We need adaptive, multi-level governance, similar to climate governance models, to address cross-system risks

---

## Trend 4  
### Breaking Out of Legacy Mobilization Networks

From:  
Bailo (2025)  
“Breaking Out of Legacy Mobilization Networks”

Key insights:
- Digital media can activate political participation among politically disengaged groups traditionally excluded from social capital networks
- Platforms like Meetup.com can bypass geographic and network barriers, creating **Internet capital** that supports grassroots mobilization
- However, online networks often lack the cohesive, reciprocal ties of legacy social capital, requiring external validation (e.g., media attention) to sustain activation

---

## Challenge 4  
### Political Turbulence and the Style of Mobilized Discontent

- Platform affordances that help mobilize disengaged and discontented groups can also:
  - Favor fast, emotional, and disruptive political styles over reflective, deliberative engagement
  - Amplify polarizing or extreme sentiments rather than foster constructive debate
- Mobilization without strong connective or deliberative infrastructures risks fueling political turbulence
- → Strategic challenge: How can we design digital environments that enable activation without undermining the quality of political deliberation?

---

## Synthesis

### Emerging Trends

✅ AI and platforms reshape political engagement  
✅ Information crises amplify epistemic gaps  
✅ Platform governance faces legitimacy challenges  
✅ Decentralized misuse (Underspheres) creates regulatory blind spots  
✅ Digital media can bypass legacy mobilization networks but favor turbulent, non-deliberative political styles

---

## Key Challenges for Government & Regulators

1. Governing coordinated manipulation across crises  
2. Building transparent, trusted moderation regimes  
3. Designing adaptive risk frameworks for AI misuse  
4. Addressing how platform affordances shape the style and quality of political engagement  
5. Supporting meaningful digital participation without replicating legacy exclusions
