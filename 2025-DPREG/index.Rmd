## Why This Matters

AI, especially Generative AI technologies and tools, will be ubiquitous and strongly integrated with the existing infrastructure of digital and social platforms

In **2024**,

- **Over half of Australians** (51%) accessed **news more than once a day**, a 3 percentage point increase from the prior year.
- **Almost half of Australians** (49%) **used social media to access news**, marking a 4 percentage point increase since the prior year.
- **Nearly two-thirds of Gen Z** (60%) **relied on social media as their main news source**, a significant increase of 17 percentage points over the past year.
- Trust in news generally fell slightly (-3pp) to 40%, but **distrust rose consistently and reached its highest point since 2016** (33%, +8pp).

### These systems increasingly mediate: 

- Access to political information
- Political engagement and participation
- Electoral and civic processes

### Our recent research shows these systems:

.content-box-yellow[

1. Reshape *who* is reached and *how* people are activated politically; 
2. Create new risks of information disorders;
3. Challenge regulatory and governance models.

## Trend 1  
### Information Disorder and Political Performance


.content-box-yellow[
#### Key insights from our study:
- Far-right actors in Australia amplified their performance online during crises (bushfires, COVID-19)
- They moved from peripheral actors to central positions in the public Twitter conversation
- **AI + platforms amplify epistemic gaps** — people seek meaning where the official system lags

## Challenge 1  

### Coordinated Manipulation

.content-box-yellow[

- Coordinated, either authentic or inauthentic behavior (bots, cyborg accounts, social manipulation).
- Far-right networks linked to QAnon **overperformed** while spreading COVID-19 misinformation.
- Platforms struggle to detect or simply decide to ignore coordinated influence campaigns.
- In fact, platforms often amplifies conflicting, outrageous content thus increasing overall information disorder.  
- → Regulatory challenge: How do we govern digital ecosystems that can be hijacked at scale?

]

## Trend 2  
### Platform Governance and Resistance

.content-box-yellow[

#### Key insights from our study:
- Meta’s strategies (labels, shadow bans) reduced some COVID-19 misinformation but:
  - Communities developed **resistance tactics** (social steganography, migration to less-moderated spaces)
  - Moderation transparency gaps fueled conspiratorial thinking
  
- Also,
  - In the US, platforms such as Meta stopped many content moderation activities after the 2024 election, raising concerns about the future handling of misinformation
  - Meta and X (formerly Twitter) have made it increasingly difficult for academics and journalists to access social media data, limiting independent oversight (referencing our Conversation article on coordinated, inauthentic behavior)

## Challenge 2  

.content-box-yellow[

### Moderation Backfires and Trust Erosion

- Content moderation can amplify perceptions of political bias or censorship
- Platform opacity invites backlash from fringe and mainstream actors alike
- → Governance question: How can statutory authorities ensure fair, transparent platform governance without escalating distrust?

]

## Trend 3  
### AI Misuse and Creative Underspheres


.content-box-yellow[

#### Key insights from our study:
- Generative AI fosters emergent, informal creative communities (*Underspheres*)
- These communities often innovate **outside** normative frameworks — but can also:
  - Create and distribute deepfakes, disinformation, non-consensual media
  - Bypass existing legal and regulatory boundaries
  
]

---

## Challenge 3  
### Complex Risk, Not Just High/Low Risk

.content-box-yellow[

- GenAI systems introduce **complex, emergent risks**
- Current regulatory frameworks (like EU AI Act) are rigid, focused on **market actors**
- But most severe risks (e.g., AI-driven disinformation) emerge from decentralized, non-market misuse
- → Policy challenge: We need adaptive, multi-level governance, similar to climate governance models, to address cross-system risks

]

---

## Trend 4  
### Breaking Out of Legacy Mobilization Networks

.content-box-yellow[

#### Key insights from my study:
- Digital media can activate political participation among politically disengaged groups traditionally excluded from social capital networks
- Platforms like Meetup.com can bypass geographic and network barriers, creating **Internet capital** that supports grassroots mobilization
- However, online networks often lack the cohesive, reciprocal ties of legacy social capital, requiring external validation (e.g., media attention) to sustain activation

]

.footnote[F. Bailo, ‘Breaking out of legacy mobilization networks: How the Internet reaches and activates the politically disengaged’, Journal of Information Technology & Politics, 2025, doi: 10.1080/19331681.2025.2494116.]

---

## Challenge 4  
### Political Turbulence and the Style of Mobilized Discontent

.content-box-yellow[

- Platform affordances that help mobilize disengaged and discontented groups can also:
  - Favor fast, emotional, and disruptive political styles over reflective, deliberative engagement
  - Amplify polarizing or extreme sentiments rather than foster constructive debate
- Mobilization without strong connective or deliberative infrastructures risks fueling political turbulence
- → Strategic challenge: How can we design digital environments that enable activation without undermining the quality of political deliberation?

]


---

## Trend 5

### Platforms as Powerful Political Actors

.content-box-yellow[

#### Key insights from our study:

- Platforms are not just passive infrastructures; 
- They **emerge as powerful political actors** shaping the rules, standards, and visibility of political communication

- Multi-platform environments combine centripetal (leadership control) and centrifugal (grassroots empowerment) forces, creating fragmented but influential political arenas

]

.footnote[F. Marolla, M. Miotto, G. Cassani, and F. Bailo, ‘Affording fragmented audiences: Multi-platform deliberation within the Five Star Movement’, 2025.

---

## Challenge 5

.content-box-yellow[

### Navigating Multi-Platform Power and Affordances

Different platform affordances (visibility, associability) structure how leaders and members engage across networks

Grassroots platforms foster horizontal, participatory spaces; top-down platforms amplify centralized control

→ Key challenge: How can we harness multi-platform environments to strengthen internal party democracy and avoid reinforcing hierarchical, exclusionary dynamics?

]

## Synthesis

### Emerging Trends

- AI and platforms reshape political engagement
- Information crises amplify epistemic gaps
- Platform governance faces legitimacy challenges
- Decentralized misuse (Underspheres) creates regulatory blind spots
- Digital media can bypass legacy mobilization networks but favor turbulent, non-deliberative political styles
- Platforms are emerging as powerful political actors, reshaping multi-platform political environments



---

## Key Challenges for Government & Regulators

1. Governing coordinated manipulation across crises

2. Building transparent, trusted moderation regimes

3. Designing adaptive risk frameworks for AI misuse

4. Addressing how platform affordances shape the style and quality of political engagement

5. Supporting meaningful digital participation without replicating legacy exclusions

6. Understanding and navigating the power of multi-platform environments in shaping political organization
