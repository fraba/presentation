## The Research Problem

.font120[**Current AI regulations are failing to protect people from real harms**]

--

.pull-left[
**What regulators do:**
- Focus on predictable uses
- Categorize static risks
- Regulate what we know
]

--

.pull-right[
**What's happening:**
- Creative communities repurpose AI
- New, unexpected harms emerge
- Risks are complex and evolving
]

--

.font130[
**The Gap:** How do we regulate AI when we can't predict how people will use it?
]

## Introducing the Undersphere

### Networked communities united by creative experimentation with technology

--

.pull-left[
**Key Characteristics:**

- Share expertise, not social bonds

- Task-focused, not community-building

- Apolitical spaces

- Span multiple platforms
]

--

.pull-right[
**Definition:**

Workshop for technology tinkerers

Members united by the task

Outcomes can be harmful, even when communities aren't

## Case Study: r/StableDiffusion

--

.pull-left[
**The Community**
- 600,000+ members on Reddit
- AI image generation (Stable Diffusion)
- Share creative works and code

**Appears harmless:**
- Artistic experimentation
- Creative outputs
]

--

.pull-right[
**Spawns harmful offshoots:**
- Non-consensual deepfake porn
- NSFW AI communities
- Code shared across platforms
- Operates beyond regulation
]

---

## The Deepfake Precedent

--

.pull-left[
**Timeline**

**2017:** First deepfake porn

**2019:** 14,678 videos online

**2023:** 95,820 videos
- 550% increase
- 98% pornographic
- 99% feature women without consent
]

--

.pull-right[
**Real Harms**

- Privacy violations
- Reputation damage
- Harassment
- Career destruction
- Undermines democracy
]

## Why Current Regulations Fail

### The EU AI Act's Risk-Based Approach

--

**What it does:**
- Categorizes by intended use
- Identifies predictable applications
- Bans certain uses

--

**What it misses:**
- Creative misappropriation
- Assumes knowable risks
- Static, not evolving
- Slow to respond

--

.font120[
**By the time regulators act, harm has already spread**
]

---

## Complex Risks

.white[**AI risks parallel climate risks**]

--

.white[
.pull-left[
**Interconnected**  
Effects spread across systems

**Amplified**  
Algorithms multiply content
]

.pull-right[
**Cascading**  
Innovation becomes weaponized

**Systemic**  
Threatens democratic principles
]
]

--

.white[
.font130[
**Unknown risks require adaptive responses**
]
]

---

## Why AI Risks Are Complex

--

**Multiple unknowns** – Models aren't fully understood

--

**Creative repurposing** – Constant new uses

--

**Rapid scaling** – Knowledge spreads quickly

--

**Unpredictable interactions** – AI meets social media, politics, markets

--

**Emergent harms** – Arise from unanticipated interactions

--

## A Better Approach

--

.pull-left[
**Current: Risk Categories**
- Probable uses
- Static categories
- Reactive
- Slow
]

--

.pull-right[
**Proposed: Adaptive Governance**
- Continuous monitoring
- Flexible responses
- Evolves with technology
- Reflexive coordination
]

--

.font110[
**Key requirements:** Observability, Inspectability, Flexibility

## Key Takeaways

--

.font110[
**1.** Underspheres experiment with AI unpredictably
]

--

.font110[
**2.** Current regulations miss emerging harms
]

--

.font110[
**3.** Deepfakes show how creative tools become weapons
]

--

.font110[
**4.** AI risks are complex and systemic
]

--

.font110[
**5.** We need adaptive governance
]

--

.font120[
**AI regulation must account for what we don't yet know**
