  abstract = {Studies conducted before the massification of the ICTs have estimated that about 80\% of those joining a political movement had pre-existing connections with people already in the movement (Diani and Lodi, 1989). The role of social capital in facilitating mobilisation is well supported theoretically and empirically (Seyd and Whiteley 2004; Ostrom and Ahn 2007). Internet technologies should theoretically reduce the importance of existing face-to-face networks and social capital for political mobilisation (Lybeck, Koiranen \& Koivula 2023): Internet users can more easily activate connections to a political movement, even in the absence of any existing direct, personal connection. We investigate whether this is the case using responses to an online survey (n = 698) administered to participants at face-to-face meetings organised to support Italy’s M5S. The case study is particularly pertinent to assess our research question as the selected party is one of Europe’s main digital native political organisations (Gerbaudo 2018). Not surprisingly, preliminary results indicate that “pre-existing connections” are, on average, still critical. Taking advantage of the uneven distribution of social capital between northern and southern regions and using a number of control questions about political interest and knowledge, political distrust and individual participatory experiences, we further investigate frequency and characteristics of instances where ICTs appeared to have successfully substituted social capital in recruiting participants.},

Leading scholars in the field assess the evidence for partisan decline or adaptation for 20 OECD nations. This book documents the broadscale erosion of the public's partisan identities in virtually all advanced industrial democracies. It demonstrates how political parties have adapted to partisan dealignment by strengthening their internal organizational structures and partially isolating themselves from the ebbs and flows of electoral politics. Centralized, professionalized parties with short time horizons have replaced the ideologically driven mass parties of the past. Parties without Partisans is the most comprehensive cross‐national study of parties in advanced industrial democracies in all of their forms—in electoral politics, as organizations, and in government.},

  abstract = {The ways in which citizens experience politics on social media have overall positive implications for political participation and equality in Western democracies. This book investigates the relationship between political experiences on social media and institutional political participation based on custom-built post-election surveys on samples representative of Internet users in Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Poland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States between 2015 and 2018. On the whole, social media do not constitute echo chambers, as most users see a mixture of political content they agree and disagree with. Social media also facilitate accidental encounters with news and exposure to electoral mobilization among substantial numbers of users. Furthermore, political experiences on social media have relevant implications for participation. Seeing political messages that reinforce one’s viewpoints, accidentally encountering political news, and being targeted by electoral mobilization on social media are all positively associated with participation. Importantly, these political experiences enhance participation, especially among citizens who are less politically involved. Conversely, the participatory benefits of social media do not vary based on users’ ideological preferences and on whether they voted for populist parties. Finally, political institutions matter, as some political experiences on social media are more strongly associated with participation in majoritarian systems and in party-centric systems. While social media may be part of many societal problems, they can contribute to the solution to at least two important democratic ills—citizens’ disconnection from politics and inequalities between those who choose to exercise their voice and those who remain silent.},

  abstract = {More than 300 studies have been published on the relationship between digital media and engagement in civic and political life. With such a vast body of research, it is difficult to see the big picture of how this relationship has evolved across time and across the globe. This article offers unique insights into how this relationship manifests across time and space, using a meta-analysis of existing research. This approach enables an analysis of a 20-year period, covering 50 countries and including survey data from more than 300,000 respondents. While the relationship may vary cross-nationally, the major story is the trend data. The trend data show a pattern of small, positive average coefficients turning into substantial, positive coefficients. These larger coefficients may be explained by the diffusion of this technology across the masses and changes in the types of use, particularly the rise of social networking sites and tools for online political participation.},

Existing research focuses on whether political actors successfully engage citizens, and how social media platforms mobilise young people into offline participation. In this article, we present original survey data on how many young people use social media to do politics: share information, express themselves, and take action. Everyday Facebook use is underpinned by young people’s engaged citizenship norms, and it has the potential to mobilise a broader range of young people. We contextualise the survey findings with qualitative analysis of how young people describe their willingness to engage in politics on social media. There is a general reluctance to take political action due to the possibility of conflict and disagreement within their networks; however, some acknowledge it is a way to bring the disengaged into political debate.},
