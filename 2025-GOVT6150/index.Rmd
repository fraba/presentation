# The Internet Revolution - From Novelty to Utility


---

## The Transformation of Digital Connectivity

### Key Technological Drivers
- **Computing Power**: Exponential increases following Moore's Law - processing power doubled every 18 months
- **Bandwidth Revolution**: From 300 bits/second (1970s) to 1 billion bits/second (2011)
- **Broadband Adoption**: <5% in 2000 → 61% by 2011 in the US
- **File Compression**: Enabled transmission of rich media content
- **"All You Can Eat" Pricing**: Flat-rate access encouraged experimentation

---

### The Broadband Transformation
- **Catalyst for Behavioural Change**: High-speed connections transformed Internet from novelty to essential utility
- **Enhanced User Engagement**: Broadband users became "heavier consumers and creators of online material"
- **Always-On Culture**: Shift from dial-up (competing with phone calls) to continuous connectivity
- **Video and Rich Media**: 71% of Internet users regularly watched video online by 2011

### Social and Political Implications
- **Personalised Internet Experiences**: Each individual creates tailored online environments
- **Networked Information Environment**: Computers became extensions of the Internet rather than standalone devices
- **Changed Contact Point**: From household/work group access to individual-centred connectivity
- **98% Integration**: By 2011, more than 98% of computer users were Internet users

---

class: segue-yellow

# The Mobile Revolution - Always-Available Accessibility

---

## From Communication Device to Body Appendage

### Rapid Global Adoption
- **Fastest Consumer Technology Adoption in History**: Mobile phones achieved unprecedented global penetration
- **US Transformation**: More mobile lines than landlines by 2006; nearly 30% mobile-only by 2010
- **Essential Technology**: Mobile phone became the "#1 hardest to give up" device by 2007

### Four Pillars of Mobile Connectivity
1. **Lightweight Portable Computing**: Laptops, netbooks, tablets, and smartphones
2. **Wireless Internet Access**: Broadband connections available wherever there's a signal
3. **Cloud Computing**: Email, documents, and media stored on remote servers accessible from any device
4. **Application Ecosystem**: Apps transformed smartphones into "diversified personal and portable computing devices"

---

### Social and Political Transformation
- **"Continuous Partial Attention"**: Users orient attention across multiple networks and information sources simultaneously
- **Space and Time Become "Softer"**: People find each other "in due course" - physical presence and "absent presence" integrate
- **Your Place is Where Your Connectivity Is**: Location redefined by network access rather than physical geography
- **Hyperconnectedness**: 84% of teens take phones to bed; some report phones feel like "part of their body"

---

### Democratic Implications
- **Individual Network Control**: Greater control over outreach to others and availability to others
- **Reduced Group Embeddedness**: People perceive themselves less as "embedded members of fixed groups"
- **Political Mobilisation**: Enhanced ability to create personal networks around shared interests regardless of geographic distance
- **Information Access**: Immediate access to information and fact-checking capabilities during political events

# The Social Network Revolution - Beyond Facebook

---

## The Foundation Revolution: From Groups to Networks

### Core Conceptual Shift
- **Not Technology-Driven**: Social Network Revolution came FIRST - before Internet and Mobile Revolutions
- **Relationship Transformation**: Shift from "embedded group members" to "connected individuals"
- **Network vs. Groups**: Society made of "tangle of networked individuals" rather than "solidary, tightly bounded groups"
- **Focus on Relationships**: Network analysts study characteristics of relationships rather than individual traits

---

### The Networked Individual
- **Partial Membership**: People belong to multiple networks rather than single groups
- **Specialised Relationships**: Different network members meet different needs (emotional support, professional advice, local logistics)
- **Active Network Management**: Requires "choreography and exertion" to maintain diverse connections
- **Social Capital Distribution**: Resources distributed across loose networks rather than tight groups

### Political Implications
- **Beyond Locality**: Networks transcend geographical and social boundaries
- **Personal Responsibility**: Individual bears burden of maintaining political connections
- **Network Mavens**: Some better able to navigate and operate networked systems than others
- **Trust as Currency**: Primary currency of social networks becomes building and maintaining trust

Mark Zuckerberg, founder and CEO of Facebook in 2005. 

On **September 26, 2006**, Facebook opened to everyone at least 13 years old with a valid email address.

---

## From Friendster to Facebook: The Transformation of Social Connection

### The Cloud Computing Breakthrough
- **MySpace and Facebook**: Made "living in the cloud" mainstream - people started using cloud services without realising it
- **The Killer App**: Social networking sites answered the compelling question "What are my friends doing now?"
- **Collaborative Functions**: Shared passwords, co-editing documents, shared calendars accessible from any device
- **Always-On Social Connection**: Integration of mobile devices with cloud-based social platforms

---

### The Rise of Social Networking Sites
- **Evolutionary Path**: Friendster → MySpace → Facebook (each building on predecessors)
- **Massive Adoption**: 50% of American adults using social networking sites by 2011
- **Demographics**: Fastest growing cohort became individuals over age 50 (2010 onwards)
- **Dashboard Function**: Social networking sites became "dashboards of the Internet for networked individuals"

.center[<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/95/Friendster_logo_new.svg'width = '30%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/MySpace_logo.svg' width = '30%'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img src = 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Facebook.svg' width = '30%'>]

---

### Transformation of Social Connection
- **Visible Social Networks**: Made social relationships "more salient" and allowed unprecedented information sharing about friendships
- **Networked Self**: Single self that "gets reconfigured in different situations" - like an amoeba with core nucleus and changing pseudopods
- **Integration of Online/Offline**: Research shows people's online and offline interactions are "almost always integrated"
- **Mutual Exchange**: Enables "visible conversations, spikes and bursts of text, controlled graffiti of tagging and commenting"

---

### Democratic and Political Implications
- **Network Amplification**: Social media strengthened existing network patterns rather than replacing them
- **Information Filtering**: People cycle between internet searches and social network discussions to make sense of information
- **Privacy vs. Transparency**: Loss of privacy and "unwanted commercialisation of personal information"
- **Surveillance Capabilities**: Companies can "aggregate and analyse" user information - "We know where you are, where you've been, what you're thinking"

# Let's now go back to our central question: 

# How does the massification of digital media transform political communication, and does this transformation strengthen or weaken democratic participation and institutions?

---

## Why This Matters
- **Digital media now central to political life**: Information, mobilisation, participation
- **Democratic institutions under pressure**: Trust declining, polarisation increasing
- **New forms of political action**: Bypassing traditional gatekeepers
- **Urgent policy questions**: Platform regulation, algorithmic accountability

### Key Tension
- Digital media promise **democratisation** (broader access, lower barriers) but ...

- it may **weaken institutions** (fragmented publics, algorithmic manipulation, anti-establishment mobilisation)

---

## Our Analytical and Conceptual Framework

### 1. **Algorithmic Mediation** (Soffer, 2021)
How algorithms (and digital platforms) replace human gatekeepers in political information flow

### 2. **Internet vs. Social Capital** (Bailo, 2025)
How digital networks enable new forms of political mobilisation outside traditional institutions

### 3. **The Participation Paradox** (Heiss & Matthes, 2019)
How digital media may reinforce rather than reduce political inequalities

---

# Traditional Political Communication

## The Mass Media Model (Pre-Digital)

### Key Features
- **Centralised broadcasting**: Few-to-many communication
- **Professional gatekeepers**: Journalists, editors, producers
- **Scheduled consumption**: Fixed times, shared experiences
- **Geographic constraints**: Local media, place-based communities

### Political Implications
- **Shared public sphere**: Common information environment
- **Institutional mediation**: Parties, unions, civic associations as intermediaries
- **Elite control**: Limited access to mass communication

---

# Enter Digital Media - The Transformation Begins

## From Mass to Network Communication

### Technological Shifts
- **Many-to-many communication**: Everyone can broadcast
- **Algorithmic curation**: Personalised information flows
- **Always-on access**: Continuous connectivity
- **Global reach**: Geographic boundaries dissolved

### Initial Promises
- **Democratisation**: Lower barriers to participation
- **Diversity**: More voices, perspectives, sources
- **Interactivity**: Two-way communication
- **Empowerment**: Citizens as creators, not just consumers

# PART I - ALGORITHMIC MEDIATION

---

## The New Gatekeepers

*Soffer (2021): "Algorithmic Personalisation and the Two-Step Flow of Communication"*

### Central Question

.content-box-yellow[

How do algorithms function as the new "opinion leaders" in political communication?

]

.footnote[Soffer, O. (2021). Algorithmic Personalization and the Two-Step Flow of Communication. *Communication Theory*, 31(3), 297–315. https://doi.org/10.1093/ct/qtz008]

---

# The Classical Two-Step Flow Model

## Katz & Lazarsfeld's Original Theory (1955)

### The Process
1. **Media → Opinion Leaders**: Influential individuals consume mass media
2. **Opinion Leaders → General Public**: Personal influence shapes attitudes

### Key Elements
- **Human intermediaries**: Social validation and interpretation
- **Social proximity**: Opinion leaders share group membership
- **Personal relationships**: Trust based on social connections
- **Visible mediation**: People know who influences them

---

# Problems with the Classical Model

## Why Two-Step Flow Breaks Down in Digital Era

### Digital Disruptions
- **Abundance of sources**: No single "mass media" 
- **Personalised feeds**: Individual information environments
- **Algorithmic curation**: Automated content selection
- **Invisible mediation**: Users unaware of algorithmic influence

### The Need for New Theory
Traditional human intermediaries replaced by **algorithmic intermediaries**

---

# Introducing the Algorithmic Two-Step Flow

## Soffer's Theoretical Innovation

### The New Process
1. **Media → Algorithms → Individual Users**: Personalised content curation
2. **Algorithms as Digital Opinion Leaders**: Invisible gatekeeping function

### Key Insight
Algorithms perform **similar functions** to opinion leaders:
- **Content selection**: Choose what information to show
- **Personalisation**: Tailor content to user characteristics  
- **Social validation**: Use peer behaviour to guide recommendations

---

# How Algorithms Function as Opinion Leaders

## The Mechanics of Algorithmic Mediation

### Input Factors
.small[
- **User behaviour**: Clicks, time spent, engagement
- **Social signals**: Friends' activities, viral content
- **Demographic data**: Age, location, interests
- **Contextual factors**: Time, device, recent searches
]

### Outputs
.small[
- **Personalised feeds**: Customised information flows
- **Recommendation systems**: "People like you also viewed..."
- **Trending topics**: Algorithmic amplification
- **Targeted advertising**: Political and commercial messages
]
---

# From Solid to Liquid Peer Groups

## Soffer's Key Concept: "Liquid" Networks

### Traditional Peer Groups
.small[
- **Stable membership**: Family, colleagues, neighbours
- **Geographic proximity**: Physical co-location
- **Multiplex relationships**: Multiple connection types
- **Social validation**: Clear group norms
]

### Algorithmic Peer Groups
.small[
- **Data-driven formation**: "Users like you"
- **Liquid membership**: Constantly changing based on behaviour
- **Single-issue connections**: Narrow interest overlap
- **Invisible boundaries**: Users unaware of group membership
]

---

# The Authority Problem

## Who Do We Trust in Algorithmic Systems?

### Traditional Authority Sources

.small[
- **Social proximity**: People like us
- **Expertise**: Recognised credentials
- **Institutional backing**: News organisations, universities
- **Transparency**: Known biases and interests
]

### Algorithmic Authority

.small[
- **Corporate algorithms**: Platform companies control
- **Trade secrets**: Proprietary systems, black boxes
- **No accountability**: Limited transparency or oversight
- **Gaming potential**: Manipulation by bad actors
]
---

# Democratic Implications of Algorithmic Mediation

## What This Means for Political Communication

### Potential Benefits
.small[
- **Personalised relevance**: Information tailored to interests
- **Efficiency**: Filtering vast information flows
- **Serendipity**: Exposure to unexpected content
- **Scale**: Serving millions of users simultaneously
]

### Democratic Risks
.small[
- **Filter bubbles**: Reduced exposure to diverse views
- **Manipulation**: Invisible editorial control
- **Polarisation**: Algorithmic amplification of extreme content
- **Loss of shared reality**: Fragmented information environments
]
---

# Case Study - Echo Chambers vs. Exposure

## Empirical Evidence on Algorithmic Effects

### The Debate
- **Filter bubble hypothesis**: Algorithms create ideological isolation
- **Incidental exposure**: Algorithms may increase diverse content exposure

### Research Findings (Mixed Evidence)

- **Some polarisation**: Partisan users see more confirmatory content
- **Some diversity**: Casual users encounter varied perspectives  
- **Platform differences**: Facebook vs. Twitter vs. TikTok effects vary
- **User agency**: People can override algorithmic suggestions

.footnote[On this debate, see also Bruns, A. (2019). *Are filter bubbles real?* Polity Press. and Vaccari, C., & Valeriani, A. (2021). *Outside the bubble: Social media and political participation in Western democracies*. Oxford University Press.]

# PART II - INTERNET VS. SOCIAL CAPITAL


---

## New Forms of Political Mobilisation
*Bailo (2025): "Breaking out of legacy mobilisation networks"*

### Central Question
How does "Internet capital" enable political mobilisation beyond traditional social capital networks?

---

# Defining Social Capital

## The Traditional Foundation of Political Participation

### What Is Social Capital?
- **Dense social networks**: High-quality, reciprocal relationships
- **Civic associations**: Unions, churches, community groups  
- **Geographic proximity**: Neighbourhood-based connections
- **Trust and reciprocity**: Mutual obligations and support

### Political Functions
- **Information sharing**: Political knowledge flows through networks
- **Civic skills**: Learning participation through group membership
- **Mobilisation**: Collective action through existing relationships
- **Validation**: Social reinforcement of political activities

---

# The Decline of Legacy Mobilisation Networks

## Why Traditional Social Capital Weakened

### Historical Changes
- **Mass party decline**: Fewer membership organisations since 1960s
- **Geographic mobility**: People move more frequently
- **Individualisation**: Cultural emphasis on personal autonomy
- **Economic restructuring**: Decline of industrial jobs, unions

### Political Consequences
- **Reduced voter turnout**: Fewer mobilisation networks
- **Geographic inequality**: High vs. low social capital areas
- **Elite capture**: Political access limited to well-connected
- **Institutional weakness**: Parties can't reach disengaged voters

---

# Introducing Internet Capital

## Definition
**Internet capital**: Digital resources that enable collective action **independently** of existing social capital structures

### Key Characteristics
- **Geographic independence**: Transcends local boundaries
- **Lower entry barriers**: Easier to join digital groups
- **Broader reach**: Can connect dispersed individuals
- **Weaker ties**: Less reciprocal commitment than social capital

### Critical Difference
Internet capital operates **parallel to** rather than **replacing** social capital

---

# Internet Capital vs. Social Capital

## Comparing Two Forms of Political Resources

| **Social Capital** | **Internet Capital** |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Dense, local networks | Sparse, distributed networks |
| High-quality relationships | Lower-quality connections |
| Geographic constraints | Geographic independence |
| Strong reciprocity | Weaker obligations |
| Slow to build | Rapid formation |
| Stable membership | Fluid participation |
| High social validation | Lower social pressure |
| Institutional embedding | Anti-institutional potential |

---

# Case Study - Italy's Five Star Movement (M5S)

### Background
- **Founded 2005**: Emerged from comedian Beppe Grillo's blog
- **No pre-existing organisation**: Pure digital origins
- **Anti-establishment**: "Anti-party system party"
- **Meetup.com platform**: Used for offline organising

### Research Question
Can Internet capital mobilise voters in **low-social capital areas** where traditional parties failed?

---

# The M5S Research Design

## Methodological Approach

### Data Sources
- **Meetup.com events (2005-2013)**: Granular mobilisation data
- **Census data**: Social capital indicators by geographic area
- **Electoral results (2013)**: Vote outcomes
- **Media coverage**: News attention to M5S

### Key Variables
- **Social capital density**: Civic associations per capita
- **Internet mobilisation**: Meetup activity and attendance
- **Media attention**: Coverage intensity over time
- **Vote share**: M5S electoral performance

---

# Two Waves of M5S Mobilisation

## The Media Attention Turning Point

### **Wave 1 (2005-2012): Legacy Networks**
- **High social capital areas**: Meetups concentrated in civic-rich regions
- **Traditional pattern**: Followed existing associational geography
- **Limited reach**: Couldn't penetrate low-engagement areas
- **Modest electoral impact**: Incremental growth

### **Wave 2 (2012-2013): Internet Breakthrough**  
- **Media surge**: Massive news coverage of M5S
- **Geographic expansion**: Meetups spread to low social capital areas
- **New demographics**: Reached previously disengaged voters
- **Electoral success**: 25% vote share in 2013 election

---

# The Role of Media Attention

### The Mechanism
**News media attention temporarily strengthens Internet network density**

### Evidence
- **Before 2012**: M5S activity correlated with social capital density
- **After 2012**: M5S expansion into areas with **low** social capital
- **Media catalyst**: TV/newspaper coverage provided external validation
- **Self-reinforcing**: Success generated more coverage, more mobilisation

### Theoretical Insight
Internet networks need **external validation** to overcome weak-tie limitations

---

# Reaching the Politically Disengaged

## Breaking Out of Elite Networks

### Traditional Problem
- **Civic associations**: Dominated by educated, high-income citizens
- **Self-selection**: Politically interested join organisations
- **Geographic clustering**: Social capital concentrated in wealthy areas
- **Exclusion**: Working-class, rural, immigrant populations underrepresented

### Internet Capital Solution
- **Lower barriers**: No formal membership requirements
- **Issue-based**: Single-issue rather than comprehensive engagement
- **Anti-establishment appeal**: Attracts those alienated from institutions
- **Emotional mobilisation**: Outrage and discontent as motivation

---

# The Dark Side - Extremism and Outrage

## When Internet Capital Enables Harmful Mobilisation

### The Emotional Requirement
- **Extreme discontent**: Internet networks need high emotional intensity
- **Outrage as fuel**: Anger overcomes weak-tie limitations
- **Polarising content**: Emotional messages travel faster
- **Anti-institutional bias**: Success requires rejecting status quo

### Political Consequences
- **Crowding out moderation**: Extreme voices gain advantage
- **Institutional delegitimisation**: Success undermines democratic norms
- **Emotional politics**: Rational deliberation declined
- **Unpredictability**: "Political turbulence" increases

---

# From Italy to Global Patterns

## Internet Capital in Comparative Perspective

### Similar Cases Worldwide
- **Trump 2016**: Digital mobilisation beyond GOP establishment
- **Brexit campaign**: Online networks bypass traditional parties
- **Podemos (Spain)**: Internet-enabled populist mobilisation
- **AfD (Germany)**: Far-right digital organising

### Common Patterns
- **Anti-establishment messaging**: Rejection of political elites
- **Digital-first strategy**: Online before offline organisation
- **Emotional appeals**: Outrage, fear, hope as motivators
- **Media amplification**: Traditional media coverage crucial for scale

---

# Institutional Implications

## How Internet Capital Challenges Democracy

### Positive Potential
- **Inclusion**: Reaching previously disengaged populations
- **Innovation**: New forms of political organisation
- **Responsiveness**: Direct feedback mechanisms
- **Efficiency**: Lower costs for political coordination

### Democratic Risks
- **Institutional bypass**: Circumventing representative processes
- **Legitimacy crisis**: Challenging electoral system authority  
- **Polarisation**: Advantaging extreme over moderate positions
- **Instability**: Rapid mobilisation creates unpredictable outcomes

# PART III - THE PARTICIPATION PARADOX

---

## Does Digital Media Democratise or Reinforce Inequality?
*Heiss & Matthes (2019): "Does incidental exposure on social media equalise or reinforce participatory gaps?"*

### Central Question
Do social media platforms reduce political inequalities by engaging the disengaged, or do they reinforce existing participatory gaps?

.footnote[Also see Vaccari, C., & Valeriani, A. (2021). *Outside the bubble: Social media and political participation in Western democracies*. Oxford University Press. https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190858476.001.0001]

---

# The Equalisation Hypothesis

## The Optimistic View of Digital Democracy

### Core Assumptions
- **Lower barriers**: Social media reduces costs of political engagement
- **Incidental exposure**: Non-political users accidentally encounter political content
- **Accessible participation**: Digital activities easier than offline participation
- **Inclusive platforms**: Social media reach beyond traditional civic networks

### Expected Outcome
**Digital media should reduce participatory gaps** between high and low political interest groups

---

# The Reinforcement Hypothesis

## The Pessimistic Alternative

### Counter-Arguments
- **Digital divides**: Technology access and skills unequally distributed
- **Motivation matters**: Political interest still predicts engagement
- **Algorithm bias**: Platforms may amplify rather than reduce inequalities
- **Elite capture**: Politically active dominate online spaces

### Expected Outcome
**Digital media may reinforce or even increase participatory gaps**

---

# The Incidental Exposure Mechanism

## How Casual Users Might Become Engaged

### The Process
1. **Non-political use**: Users on social media for entertainment, social connection
2. **Incidental exposure**: Encounter political content in feeds
3. **Gradual engagement**: Exposure leads to interest and participation
4. **Equalisation**: Previously disengaged users become politically active

### Previous Evidence
- **Cross-sectional studies**: Positive correlation between social media use and participation
- **Valeriani & Vaccari (2016)**: Incidental exposure linked to digital participation among low-interest users

---

# The Austrian Panel Study

## Methodological Innovation

### Research Design
- **Two-wave panel study**: Same respondents measured twice
- **N = 559**: Representative sample
- **2017 Austrian election**: High-stakes political context
- **Causal inference**: Panel design reduces reverse causation problems

### Key Measures
- **Incidental exposure**: Frequency of encountering political content on social media
- **Political interest**: Self-reported interest in politics
- **Digital participation**: Low-effort and high-effort online political activities

---

# Low-Effort vs. High-Effort Participation

## Distinguishing Types of Digital Engagement

### **Low-Effort Activities**
- **Liking** political posts
- **Sharing** political content
- **Following** political accounts
- **Commenting** on political posts

### **High-Effort Activities**  
- **Creating** political content
- **Organising** political events
- **Fundraising** for causes
- **Extended political discussions**

### Why This Matters
Different types of participation may respond differently to incidental exposure

---

# Key Findings - The Reinforcement Reality

## Panel Results Challenge Optimistic Assumptions

### **Low-Effort Participation**
- **Positive main effect**: Incidental exposure increases low-effort activities
- **No interaction**: Effect **equally distributed** across political interest levels
- **No equalisation**: High-interest users benefit as much as low-interest users

### **High-Effort Participation**
- **Significant interaction**: Effect depends on political interest
- **Reinforcement pattern**: **Negative effect** for low-interest users
- **Against equalisation**: Gap between high and low interest users **increases**

---

# Visualising the Participation Paradox

## Why Incidental Exposure Fails to Democratise

### For Low Political Interest Users
- **Superficial engagement**: Incidental exposure leads to minimal involvement
- **Slacktivist behaviour**: Easy activities that don't require sustained commitment
- **Negative correlation**: High-effort activities actually **decrease** with exposure

### For High Political Interest Users
- **Sustained engagement**: Exposure reinforces existing motivations
- **Skill development**: Digital platforms enhance pre-existing capacities
- **Cumulative advantage**: Already engaged users benefit most from new opportunities

---

# Explaining the Paradox

## Why Digital Democracy Disappoints

### **Motivation Still Matters**
- Political interest remains strongest predictor of engagement
- Technology doesn't eliminate fundamental participation requirements
- Casual exposure insufficient to overcome disinterest

### **Skill Requirements**
- High-effort participation requires digital literacy
- Political knowledge necessary for meaningful engagement  
- Social capital advantages translate to digital advantages

---

### **Algorithmic Amplification**
- Platforms reward existing engagement patterns
- Active users see more political content
- Passive users filtered away from demanding activities

---

# Broader Implications - Three Studies Converge

## Synthesising Our Evidence

### **Algorithmic Mediation** (Soffer)
- New forms of gatekeeping, but **invisible and unaccountable**
- **Personalisation** fragments shared public sphere
- **Corporate control** over political information flow

### **Internet Capital** (Bailo)  
- **Bypasses traditional institutions** but requires external validation
- **Enables anti-establishment mobilisation** more than democratic inclusion
- **Emotional politics** crowds out deliberative engagement

---

### **Participation Paradox** (Heiss & Matthes)
- **Reinforces inequalities** rather than reducing them
- **Benefits already engaged** users most
- **Fails to mobilise** the truly disengaged

---

# Conclusion - Democracy in the Digital Age

## Answering Our Central Question

### **The Transformation Is Real**
Digital media fundamentally alter political communication through:
- **Algorithmic mediation** of information flows
- **Network-based mobilisation** beyond traditional institutions  
- **New forms of participation** with unequal access

### **But Institutional Weakening Dominates**
- **Gatekeeping crisis**: Loss of accountable intermediaries
- **Institutional bypass**: Anti-establishment mobilisation advantages
- **Inequality reinforcement**: Digital divides persist and deepen
- **Fragmentation**: Shared public sphere erodes

# What about the Internet in non-democratic regimes?

## How does Internet technology affect political protest in autocracies?


.pull-left[

.small[


 - Local-level data across ~70 autocratic countries
 
### Major Findings

- Internet reduces **protest occurrence**:
  - Regimes use propaganda, censorship, surveillance, digital governance

- Internet boosts **protest persistence & diffusion**:
  - Once protest starts, activists use digital tools to sustain and spread action

> “Modern communication technology can empower opposition activists — but also strengthen regime control.”

]

---

### Theoretical Contributions

- Identifies **asymmetric control**:
  - Autocracies often control where and how Internet is deployed
  - Digital tools reinforce or substitute for traditional repression (violence, bans)

- Highlights **contextual variation**:
  - Less repressive regimes rely more on digital control
  - More vulnerable once protests erupt
  
  

.content-box-yellow[

Internet expansion reduces protest overall — but makes regimes more vulnerable when unrest begins.
